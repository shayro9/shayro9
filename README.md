### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a forth-year undergraduate student in Computer Science and Mathematics at the Technion. I enjoy exploring AI, image analysis, algorithm development, and game theory. 
I love problem-solving and challenging myself with DIY projects, such as video game development or projects involving coding, electronics, and woodworking.
